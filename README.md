Maze Customizer "Minopy's Maze Customizer"

-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------

[Introduction]

This "Minopy's Maze Customizer" easily creates various mazes. and you can play with them, and output them to an image file.

Not only the vertical and horizontal size of the maze, but also the wall thickness, rounded corners, simplicity can be customized.
With excellent setting flexibility, you can quickly create any maze you want.

Also, since all of these mazes are generated based on random signals, it can be said that there is almost no chance that the same maze will be created.
Therefore, you can easily create your only-one maze.
If you don't like the created maze, you can edit it yourself.

At the same time, along with the maze automatic creation algorithm, we have also succeeded in developing an automatic maze solution algorithm.
You can instantly guide and display the path of the answer to the maze.

Also, you can use your own maze that you created as an action game. you can play with it and save it as a file or image, so it can also be used outside this application.

-Operating environment Windows XP or later
   * BGM isn't be played during the game when you are not connected to the Internet.

【Method of operation】

Although it is an operation method, it is omitted because there is no such difficult operation.

However, I will only explain the dedicated file and the image file.

・Maze file (* .mzd)
It is a maze file that can be used only in this "Maze Maze Customizer".
".Mzd" is added as an extension.
This file can be saved by "Save As" and "Save".
By loading this saved file, you can play with the maze. 

・ Image files (* .jpg, * .png, * .bmp)
The currently displayed file can be used externally
Save as an image file.
If you save it as an image once, the maze cannot be read from that image.
Therefore, if you want to play again or see the answer, make sure to create a maze file (* .mzd) in advance.
